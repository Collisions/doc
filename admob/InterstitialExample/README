========== iOS Interstitial Example ==========

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google AdMob Ads SDK. You must
add the SDK library and header files into your application.  The SDK files can
be downloaded from https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/.

You must also include you publisher ID from AdMob in order to successfully
receive ads.  The publisher ID is defined in the app delegate implementation.
